README â€“ FLC Design for Assisted Home Common Area
This project implements a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to automate and optimize environmental and safety conditions in the common area of an assisted home. The system processes multiple sensor inputs, including patient vitals, CO2 levels, temperature, humidity, voice commands, and time, to regulate various outputs such as heating, ventilation, lighting, alarms, and accessibility features.

Key Features:
Mamdani Fuzzy Inference Model for intuitive rule-based decision-making

Centroid Defuzzification for smooth and precise control outputs

38 Fuzzy Rules to manage temperature, safety, and comfort dynamically

Rule Activation Analysis & Control Surface Plots to validate system performance

GitHub Repository includes MATLAB implementation, fuzzy membership functions, rule definitions, and simulation results

This FLC provides a smart, adaptive, and efficient control system that enhances safety and comfort in assisted living spaces.
